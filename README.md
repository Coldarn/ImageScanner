ImageScanner
============

This is a cross-platform python adapter for capturing PIL images directly from scanners.

This is a fork of the [original mercurial repository imagescanner](https://code.google.com/p/imagescanner/) hosted on code.google.com with several fixes to reduce extraneous logging and add support for setting scan resolutions in the TWAIN backend.
